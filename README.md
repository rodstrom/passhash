# passhash
This project contains two separate password hashers compatible with passwords generated by [wijjo/passhash](https://github.com/wijjo/passhash), [ginkel/hashit](https://github.com/ginkel/hashit) & each other

## Web
Visit the [GitHub Pages](https://rodstrom.github.io/passhash/) hosted version to try it out.

This is based off of the deprecated Firefox extension "Password Hasher" [wijjo/passhash](https://github.com/wijjo/passhash).

## CLI
Compile and build with the following commands:
```java 
javac passhash.java
java passhash
```

The program will first ask for the site tag and the master key, then it displays the hashed password for a few seconds before masking it. Before the password has been masked, it is important not to enter anything into the terminal, just copy the displayed password.

This is based off of the Android app "Hash It!" [ginkel/hashit](https://github.com/ginkel/hashit).

### Current limitations
The CLI is currently only working for size 26 passwords, parameters or more prompts will need to be added in order to support other sizes. Other "advanced" options are also missing at this time. 

The web version looks dated and should be redesigned. 

Both versions would be improved if it was possible to increase the size further beyond 26, in that case a warning should be displayed that it is no longer compatible with the original versions.
